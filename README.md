## Hello, Guest!

Welcome to my homepage.

I am Alexander, I like read books, learn something new and of course to code.
It is more effective to learn by doing, so I pick some task in
the field that inerest me and try to solve some problems.

Right now I am focusing on __automation__ my __work reports__ and __time expensive tasks__.
You can see current state of this work [here](https://github.com/PiAlexander/Automation-of-work-reports)

In the near future I have plans to write some __bots__.
You will see it apparently [here](https://github.com/PiAlexander/bots)

Peace
